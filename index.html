        I worked as a Netsuite Developer for one of the best Netsuite Consultancy company. I originally have no knowledge about Netsuite, but allong the way I found it an amazing ERP system which allows business to have access to their business customization needs in one place. <br />

        As a Netsuite Developer, I have worked on various projects that made our clients business processes easier. From inventory management to billing and processing payments we have done customization that caters their business needs.
